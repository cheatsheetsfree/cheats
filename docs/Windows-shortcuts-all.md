Clipboard History Windows Key + V

There are several Windows features that can improve your productivity.
Clipboard History is one that I use all the time. With a quick Windows
Key + V shortcut, you can access your recently copied items (text and
screenshots), pin your favorites, or clear the whole list when you want
a fresh start. This is one of the features that I often use, especially
when doing deep research on certain topics for work and personal
projects.

Windows: For quick access to individual Control Panel tools, like
display options and administrative tools, type some simple commands into
Windows' run dialog. It'll save you the hassle of jumping through the
default Control Panel view's hoops.

Windows 7 and Vista were a great leap forward from Windows XP, but the
Control Panel has become more difficult to use.

You can get to the Control Panel quickly, by calling up the run box with
the Win + R shortcut and then typing "control" and hitting Enter.

A better use of the run dialog, however, is to completely bypass the
main Control Panel view by adding the name of the tool you want to get
to. For example:

To jump to your desktop settings, type "control desktop" into the run
box.

You can get to your printers folder by entering "control printers".

Access the system's Administrative Tools by typing "control admintools".

For managing your network connections, type "control netconnections".

There are several other Control Panel applications and folders you can
launch from the run dialog or the command prompt, including your: mouse,
keyboard, fonts, scheduled tasks ("schedtasks"), and users and passwords
("userpasswords").

For many common tools, the syntax is straightforward, but sometimes you
may need to enter the \*.cpl file name in the command. Type in "control
desk.cpl" to access your display settings or "control powercfg.cpl" for
the power management options.
